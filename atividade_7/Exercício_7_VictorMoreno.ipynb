        "## Test the merged model\n",
        "\n",
        "The following code performs the inference stage of the evaluation finetuned Mistral-7B-Instruct model. We define a function called **`classify_sentence`** that is designed to use a pretrained model, likely a variant of a large language model similar to GPT, for sentiment analysis. The description below outlines the steps taken in the function to classify the sentiment of a given sentence as either positive, negative, or possibly neutral. I'll expand on the description by going through the function step-by-step:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The function accepts a single parameter, `sentence`, which is the text input whose sentiment is to be classified.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The `sentence` is formatted with the predefined prompt template. This prompt engineering is a common practice when using language models for specific tasks, as it provides context to the model about the task it is supposed to perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The `tokenizer` is applied to the formatted text. Tokenizers convert text into a format that models can understand, which in this case is a series of tokens. The tokenizer is configured to:\n",
        "   - Return tensors compatible with PyTorch (`return_tensors=\"pt\"`).\n",
        "   - Not add special tokens that are usually used to indicate the start and end of a sequence (`add_special_tokens=False`).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The tokenized input (`encodeds`) is then converted to a PyTorch tensor and moved to the appropriate device (GPU) for inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The inference is performed inside a `torch.no_grad()` context manager, which disables gradient calculations. This is used because we are making predictions, not training the model, and therefore do not need gradients, which would only use extra memory and computational power.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The `model.generate` function is called to generate a response. This function takes several parameters, such as:\n",
        "   - `**model_inputs`: The tokenized inputs prepared earlier.\n",
        "   - `max_length=8000`: This sets the maximum length of the model's output. The choice of 8000 seems unusually high for sentence classification and might be tailored to specific requirements of the task or the model's capacity.\n",
        "   - `bos_token_id=model.config.bos_token_id`: This specifies the beginning-of-sentence token id, signaling the model where a new sentence starts.\n",
        "   - `eos_token_id=model.config.eos_token_id`: This specifies the end-of-sentence token id, signaling the model where a sentence ends.\n",
        "   - `pad_token_id=model.config.eos_token_id`: This is used for padding shorter sentences to a uniform length. It's unusual to see the end-of-sentence token used for padding, which could be a specific requirement of this model or a mistake.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. After the model generates a response, `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` is called to free up unused memory on the GPU. This is helpful in managing GPU resources, especially when processing multiple requests or dealing with large models.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Finally, the `tokenizer.decode` function is used to convert the model's output tokens back into human-readable text. The `skip_special_tokens=True` argument removes any special tokens (like padding or end-of-sentence tokens) from the output. The function also skips the input tokens (`outputs[0][len(model_inputs[\"input_ids\"][0]):]`) to only return the newly generated text.\n"
